# Water-Sensor-Prediction
Water Sensor Prediction 

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive system for analyzing data from water sensors. The system leverages machine learning algorithms and real-time analytics to forecast critical metrics such as water levels, flow rates, and quality parameters based on historical and live sensor data.

Key Features:

Data Processing: Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing water sensor datasets.
Prediction Models: Pre-trained models for forecasting water metrics, built using tools like Python, TensorFlow, or Scikit-learn.
Integration: APIs or modules for integrating with IoT water sensors for real-time data ingestion.
Deployment: Tools for deploying the model to cloud or edge devices, ensuring real-time predictions.
Visualization: Dashboards for monitoring sensor readings and prediction outputs.
Potential Use Cases:

Predicting water scarcity or flooding events.
Monitoring water quality in industrial or environmental contexts.
Optimizing water distribution in smart cities.
Technology Stack:

Programming: Python, R, or MATLAB
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Database: SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase)
Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Grafana
